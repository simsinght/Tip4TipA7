							<h1>Here's a simple walkthrough!</h1>
			                <div>
			                	<p class="helpTitle">The Purpose</p>
			                	<p> Tip4Tip allows those who are having issues with technology to connect with 'tipsters' -
			                		real users can provide you help via live chat! If your problem is solved, you also have the ability to provide a monetary tip to your tipster, hence Tip4Tip.
			                	</p>

			                	<p class="helpTitle">Home Page</p>
								<p> On the home page, we have four primary categories that you may be having your technology-related issue in. Click any of them if they match your issue. Otherwise, simply click the general "Connect with a Tipster" button. </p>

								<p class="helpTitle">Search Device Page</p>
								<p> You got to this page from clicking one of the four categories on the home page. Search for your specific device in the search bar and click the option to connect with someone with expertise in that area. If you can't find your device, just click the "Connect with a Tipster" button. </p>

								<p class="helpTitle">Loading Page</p>
								<p> Next, you'll be shown to a page that gives you an estimated wait time before you're connected with a Tipster! You have the ability to enter your information (phone number or email) and then clicking the "Submit" button to get a notification once you're connected, so you can leave the site and then come back later. Otherwise, click "Start Typing" to be connected. </p>

								<p class="helpTitle">Chat Page</p>
								<p> This is the main feature: the live chat! You're now connected with a Tipster, so simply type into the text box and click "Send" to send your messages. The messages you get will show automatically. On the top right, there are two buttons: "Problem Solved" and "Attach a File." Clicking "Attach a File" allows you to attach and send a picture or file. Clicking "Problem Solved" indicates you are done with this chat and move on.</p>

								<p class="helpTitle">Rating Page</p>
								<p> Rate your Tipster out of 5 stars by clicking the star number. Then, if you want to tip him/her, click "Send a Tip". Otherwise, click "No Thank You" to return to the home page.</p>

								<p class="helpTitle">Payment Page</p>
								<p> Select a default dollar amount or type your own amount into the "Choose your own amount" text box. Fill out your credit card information into the pertinent fields and then click the "Confirm" button. Then, in the pop-up, click "Go Home" to return home. </p>
